Counter Vailing Duty (CVD) \n4. Special Additional Duty (SAD) \n5. Service Tax \n6. VAT \n7. CST \n \nThe GST likely to be subsumed all the above taxes except Customs Duty, Profession Tax, Motor Vehicle Tax, Electricity Duty etc., which may continue to be charged even after the implementation of GST.</string>
    <string name="name">\nIGST, CGST, SGST</string>

    <string name="GST_Pros_and_Cons">\nGST Pros and Cons</string>
    <string name="Pros_and_Cons">Pros: \n \n1. Simpler tax system. The entire Indian market will be a unified market which facilitates seamless movement of goods across states. \n \n2. Mitigates cascading (Tax on Tax) effect. \n \n3. More competitive exports: Exports, however, will be zero rated, meaning exporters of goods and services need not pay GST on their exports. GST paid by them on the procurement of goods and services will be refunded. \n \n4. Improved compliance and revenue collection. \n \nCons: \n \n1. Local dealers have to pay CGST in addition to SGST. \n \n2. Few sectors may end up paying more taxes than they did earlier. \n \n3. States producing goods might lose revenue.\n \n \n</string>
